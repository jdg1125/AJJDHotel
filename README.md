If you want to test the site with existing credentials, these allow you to access the two roles:

Administrator
username: jdg1125@gmail.com
pw: P@ssword1

Customer 
username: tyler@example.com
pw: P@ssword1

Otherwise, you can can register a new user, and that user will be added as a customer. To create a new administrator, you have to cross-reference the ASPNetUserRoles, 
ASPNetRoles, and ASPNetUsers tables to manually assign the ADMIN role to the desired user.
